The fleet sailed from Havana on September 20, 1641 but was heavily hit by a hurricane nine days later. Concepción got separated from the main fleet and tried to make for Puerto Rico, but on October 31 foundered and sank on a sand bank north of Hispaniola, which is now called Silver Bank after this shipwreck.
First found by William Phips in 1687, his operation managed to salvage 34 tons of silver and other treasure.[a] Back in England the expedition's revenue was assessed as £205,536.[b]
In the 20th century it was the object of several known treasure hunting expeditions: A. Korganoff in 1952, Edwin Link in 1955, Falcon-Barker in 1962[4] and Cousteau in 1968, until finally being re-discovered by Burt Webber in 1978.
